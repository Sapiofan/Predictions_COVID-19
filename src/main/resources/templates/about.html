        <p class="desc">This site describes situation of COVID-19 in the world for some
            period in past and predict data in the future. It is
            possible to observe information about 200+ countries, different regions around the world and the world itself.
            The site contains data about new cases and new deaths and
            a general number of new cases and deaths, that is confirmed ones. Also, the site builds prediction
            upon existed data and it's also shown here for every country and the world. It must be noted that predicted data
            don't guarantee that this number exactly appears in the future, it is only aproximate number, however, it still
            can be used in business and some other processes related to the virus.

            <p>Site doesn't take into account world conflicts, that means it uses all data that are loaded from out resource and
                it isn't concerned about the legal status of any country, territory or area or of its
                authorities, or concerned about the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>World statistic (new cases, deaths, confirmed cases and deaths, statistic by day and week)</li>
                    <li>Region situation (the same possible to see like in the world statistic, but for 5 regions)</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Countries (all countries are in a table, it's possible to sort it by columns, find needed country,
                    observe statistic by different dates, go to country statistic)</li>
                <li>Country (the same types of data possible to observe but for a certain country)</li>

            <p>
                All data are updated once a day. It pertains loading of existed data as well as calculating new predictions.

            <p><span class="bold">New case and death counts:</span> Counts of new cases and deaths are calculated by
                subtracting previous cumulative total counts from the current count. Due to differences in reporting methods,
                cut-off times, retrospective data consolidation and reporting delays,
                the number of new cases may not always reflect daily totals
                published by individual countries, territories or areas.</p>
            <span class="bold">Current day counts:</span> Global case and death counts
            visualised for the current day are predicted
            data until counts have been fully updated for all regions that day, that is it will be updated next day.<br> <br>
